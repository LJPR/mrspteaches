  description = " I have been a certified teacher for Seminole County Public schools for 20 years, teaching middle school math and robotics. I created and taught the LEGO Robotics curriculum for Milwee Middle School, as well as a curriculum for Artificial Intelligence Robotics, using different robots. My lessons are largely self-paced, and offer choices for students when choosing assignments. The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) commissioned me to develop and teach a short Robotics Teacher Training course for Central Florida teachers, in the summers of 2016 and 2017 .  I also  co-authored a robotics textbook called 'Actuators and the Power to do Tasks', published by Cavendish Square."
