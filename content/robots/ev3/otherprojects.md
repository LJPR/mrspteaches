These were alternate choices for the Building Project. Crossing the gap
required the team to design and build a robot to cross a gap between two
tables. This looks easy, but they found that it was very challenging,
and experienced euphoria when they finally made it work. Another choice
was making the robot move forward using linkage legs. There was a huge
variety of designs for this project.
