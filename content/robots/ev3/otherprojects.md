Early in the programming lessons, students learned to program different turns. They could then choose to develop robot art using the different turns they had learned, or have the robot move through a maze.

These were alternate choices for the Building Project. Crossing the gap
required the team to design and build a robot to cross a gap between two
tables. This looks easy, but they found that it was very challenging,
and experienced euphoria when they finally made it work. Another choice
was making the robot move forward using linkage legs. There was a huge
variety of designs for this project.
