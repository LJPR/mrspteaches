The Carnival ride project was a choice for the Final project, covering
both building and programming. The students had a rubric explaining the
requirements for the project. We saw a very wide variety of rides, and
loved to show the whole carnival at once.

## A Typing Robot Alternate Project
tudents were allowed to suggest a different project of
their choice, to be approved by the teacher - this student wanted to
design and program a robot to type the word 'hello' on the computer
keyboard, and she succeeded in this challenging project.
